# SmallAntiTamper
Just a small tool to check integrity of your file

This tool will create a file called protection.bin and if the MD5 of the exe and of the bin aren't the same, file will crash. Nothing great, 
but the original repo didn't work. 

--- ToDo List? ---

Put the file protection.bin in temp folder. Like this, There's no extra file in location
